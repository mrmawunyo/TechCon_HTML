            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of local tech enthusiasts in a university auditorium.
                Its initial goal was to create a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering innovation within the burgeoning local tech scene.
                Over the years, it rapidly grew in popularity, attracting speakers and attendees from across the nation, and eventually, the globe.
                By 2015, TechCon had established itself as a leading annual event, known for its cutting-edge discussions and vibrant community.

                In 2020, even amidst global challenges, TechCon successfully transitioned to a hybrid format, expanding its reach
                and demonstrating resilience. This adaptability has cemented its reputation as a forward-thinking conference
                that embraces new technologies not just in content, but in delivery.
